### Hi, I'm Yannick ğŸ‘‹

I'm living in beautiful Switzerland ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­ and spending most of my time there exploring â›°. I'm an Android developer @appswithlove and have a BSc in Computer Science. And well, I also dedicate a big part of my time to photography ğŸ“· (as [my website](https://yannickpulver.com) or [Instagram](https://instagr.am/yannickpulver) probably indicates.
