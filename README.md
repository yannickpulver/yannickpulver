### Hi, I'm Yannick 👋

I'm living in beautiful Switzerland 🇨🇭 and spending most of my time there exploring ⛰. I'm an Android developer @appswithlove and have a bachelor degree in Computer Science. I do personal projects from time to time. I also dedicate a big part of my time to photography 📷 (as [my website](https://yannickpulver.com) or [Instagram](https://instagr.am/yannickpulver) probably indicate).
